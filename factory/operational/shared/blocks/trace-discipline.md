## Trace Discipline — Declare Once, Cite Bare

Trace stanzas (`<!-- trace: {id, serves, kind, level, node} -->`) are DECLARED exactly once, in the
artifact that owns the element they tag — `acceptance.md` (per test/rubric line), design docs (per
design element), code adjacent to the implementation. Everything downstream — `report.md`,
reviews, plans, status — REFERENCES the bare ID (`R-003.2.1`) and never re-declares the stanza:
the E2 walker treats a re-declaration in your node as a duplicate declaration and rejects it
(DUP-ID — Run-2: a builder re-declared 10 acceptance IDs in its report and was bounced at
sign-off). IDs are minted only by the level that owns the decomposition that creates them; an ID
you were GIVEN is cited, never re-minted, never renumbered.

**Declaration ownership follows artifact ownership.** You declare trace stanzas only for IDs YOU
mint, in YOUR artifacts. A parent's brief declares the IDs it minted for the child; the child
mints strictly-deeper sub-IDs under them; given IDs are referenced bare, never re-declared. (This
is the law behind Run-2's DUP-ID bounces — parent-authored briefs and child-authored acceptance
files declaring the same IDs; the healed behavior, testers renumbering to deeper sub-IDs, is
exactly this rule.) The canonical stanza syntax, the dotted-child minting rule, and the per-level
emission obligations live in `design/PLAN-ALIGNMENT-GATE.md` (Requirements Traceability) — this
block fixes only the declare-once / cite-bare / own-what-you-declare split.
