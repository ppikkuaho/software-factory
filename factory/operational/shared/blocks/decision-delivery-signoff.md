## Decision Home and Final Sign-Off

A generated document may project or summarize a decision, but it must never be
the decision's sole home. Record the decision in its owned canonical artifact
and deliver it through the recipient's normal surface; generation is not
delivery.

Once you submit a candidate, its artifacts are frozen until the gate verdict
returns. Do not edit reviewed bytes for any reason, including to fix a defect
you just found. Report the defect and let the verdict or a fresh submission
carry the repair.

Put disposable scratch only in the harness-provisioned `.tmp` tree. Leave it in
place and report if it blocks you; the harness never requires a seat to delete
anything, so never issue destructive filesystem commands.

When the same harness substrate command fails three consecutive times with the
same error class, stop retrying it. Three identical failures are the substrate
reporting that it is broken, not your invocation; a fourth attempt spends usage
against a control plane that cannot answer. Write a substrate-fault marker —
`substrate-fault.json` in your node, naming the command, the error class, the
three attempt timestamps, and what you were trying to do — and end the turn.
Ending the turn stops the meter, and the marker is what makes the fault legible
to whoever repairs the substrate; that repair is never your work.

During ordinary work, read new inbox rows when the harness notification names
their sender and unread count. The final sign-off read below independently
covers messages that arrived mid-turn.

Before signing `DONE` or `FAILED`, read your current inbox as the
**second-to-last act**. Resolve or route anything that arrived while you were
working. Writing the terminal signal is the last act.
